/**
 * context_engine — orchestrates the ReAct loop.
 *
 * context_engine only handles OmniMessage, orchestrating the flow of events between the
 * Human, LLM, and Environment interfaces, and writes every observable action to Trace.
 * The initial version keeps a linear message history.
 *
 * Human is the SDK's input/output boundary: there is no "Human implementation/interface".
 * Input is the Prompt list passed to `run`, plus the abort signal `signal` and the
 * per-tool approval callback `approve` in `RunOptions`; output is the OmniMessage stream
 * produced by `run`.
 *
 * Docs: packages/docs/content/agent-loop.{zh,en}.md (site path /docs/agent-loop) documents
 * the turn lifecycle, carry-over, reconnect and compaction implemented here.
 *
 * Approval is an **in-turn interaction** and tool calls are **async/incremental** (see
 * comment #24):
 *   - A single `run` call automatically runs the entire ReAct loop (no more resuming in batches);
 *   - Each tool_call is emitted as soon as its stream completes → `await approve` → if
 *     allowed, it runs via Environment;
 *   - Execution **does not block** continued consumption of the LLM stream or approval of
 *     the next tool (executions can overlap), but approvals still happen one at a time;
 *   - partial/complete `tool_call_output` is yielded in **completion order**;
 *   - once all tool outputs for the turn are ready, they become the next turn's LLM input;
 *     the Task ends once a turn produces no more tool_call.
 *
 * Implementation note: an internal queue merges "the LLM event stream + N concurrent tool
 * output streams" into a single yield sequence. GenerativeModel is a stateful object
 * (AgentHub maintains the history); each turn the engine only hands it the "new" messages:
 * the user Prompt on the first turn, and the previous turn's tool_call_output afterward.

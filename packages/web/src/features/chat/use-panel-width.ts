/**
 * Width shared by the chat page's two docked panels (Workspace files and Agents), plus the
 * drag-to-resize machinery both of them mount.
 *
 * The panels are MUTUALLY EXCLUSIVE — opening one closes the other — so to the user they read
 * as a single right-hand panel that swaps its content. Two independent widths made that swap
 * jump, which is why the width is one value here rather than a per-panel preference: a width
 * dragged on either panel is the width the other one opens at, immediately and after a reload.
 *
 * "Immediately" is what rules out two `useState`s over one storage key: only the panel that was
 * mounted and dragged would update, and the other would keep a stale copy until its next
 * remount. So the value lives in a module-level store both hooks subscribe to via
 * useSyncExternalStore, and the persisted preference is written once per drag (mouseup), not
 * per frame.
 *
 * Width is a layout preference, not session data: it is never reset on a Session switch.

 * panel the narrower of the user's two choices — visibly a regression on the panel that used
 * to be wide. The migration deletes the keys as it reads, so it is already dead code for anyone
 * who has opened the app once since this shipped.
 *
 * REMOVAL: delete this constant and storedWidth()'s legacy branch in the release AFTER the one
 * shipping this change, as part of preparing that release. Nothing else in the repo reads these

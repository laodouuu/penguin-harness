/**
 * Draft view (/chat/new): the pre-persistence form of a new
 * conversation, before any Session exists. The input card sits vertically centered;
 * before sending, this is where Agent / Workspace / approval mode / Model are all
 * chosen in one place — two small dropdown pills sit right below the card (pill
 * buttons, styled after ChatGPT's project picker): Agent selection and Workspace
 * directory selection (the menu browses server-side directories, and the current
 * path can be edited directly); the model picker lives in the input card's bottom
 * toolbar, left of the send button (with a vendor logo). The Session is only
 * created when **the first message is sent**; once created, Agent / Workspace /
 * Model are locked in via meta, and only approval mode remains editable (in the
 * session-mode input area).
 *
 * Draft auto-cache (storage and validation in draft-cache.ts; keys are isolated by
 * "user × Project", #68): the four selections are saved as soon as they change;
 * body text is keystroke-frequent and deferred/coalesced (if there's an unsaved
 * change before unmount, one final write is flushed) — closing and returning to
 * the page resumes where you left off; on successful send the cache clears, except
 * the model selection, which carries over as the next conversation's default
 * (switch-becomes-default, mirroring the thinking level persisting on the Agent).
 * The sidebar group header "+" / menu "New conversation" explicitly specify an
 * Agent via route state (overriding the cached selection); the workspace-mode
 * group header "+" additionally carries a Workspace path pre-filling the
 * Workspace selection ("" = auto temp directory). A direct visit or refresh
 * falls back to the cache.
